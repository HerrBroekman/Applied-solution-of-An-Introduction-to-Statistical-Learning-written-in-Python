# Applied solution of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning*; written in Python

The aim of this project is to go through all the applied exercises that can be found in the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html) written by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. As the title of the book suggests, it is written with the R programming language in mind.  For obvious reasons, it will be useful for people who want to work with the Python language when they are reading this book. Therefore, all the solutions committed to this repository will be written in Python. When convenient, we will focus on the Scikit-Learn library, however sometimes other libraries will be used that provide better solutions to the given problem (for instance, we will use the statsmodels module for linear regression because it is easier to get diagnostic statistics such as *p* values for the regression coefficients).
